 - Basic input system, nodes, material and textures.
 - Parser for Quake4 maps written.
 - Added loader for Quake4 maps.
 - Added basic shader for diffuse mapping.
 - Added basic shader for diffuse + specular mapping.
 - Added basic shader with a parallel light.
 - Added basic shader with a point light.
 - Added basic shader with a point light + normal mapping.
 - Added basic shader with a point light + parallax mapping (needs a quake4 mod with addapted textures).

 - NEXT: Add a method to generate heighmaps starting from normal maps to implement parallax mapping without the need of using the mod.
